This repository contains code from Mapbase, a modification of the Source 2013 SDK which serves as a combined package
of general-purpose improvements, fixes, and utility features for mods.

Mapbase's main content in this repository may include:

- 80+ custom entities (new logic entities, filters, etc.)
- Hundreds of Inputs/Outputs/KeyValues additions and modifications.
- Custom SDK_ shaders with improvements adapted from Alien Swarm SDK code, including projected texture fixes and radial fog.
- Custom VScript implementation based on public Squirrel API and Alien Swarm SDK interfaces/descriptions.
- Additional gameplay control for Half-Life 2 mods, including grenade features for more NPCs and singleplayer respawning.
- More map-specific capabilities for maps unable to branch into their own mods, e.g. MP mods or map compilations.
- View rendering changes for drawing 3D skyboxes and RT-based entities.
- Countless other fixes and improvements.
- HL2MP Fixes and improvements.

Mapbase is an open-source project and its contents can be distributed and used at the discretion of its users. However, this project contains content from
a vast number of different sources which have their own licensing or attribution requirements. We try to handle most of that ourselves, but users who plan on
distributing Mapbase content are expected to comply with certain rules.

### ðŸš§ Up-to-date information about Mapbase content usage and credit are addressed in this article on Mapbase's [wiki.](https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013/wiki/Using-Mapbase-Content) ðŸš§


# EXTERNAL CONTENT USED IN MAPBASE

The Mapbase project is a combination of original code from its creators, code contributed by other Source modders, and code borrowed from open-source articles
and repositories (especially ones which are specifically published as free source code). One of Mapbase's goals is to make the most popular fixes and the most obscure
or complicated code changes accessible and easy to use for level designers and other kinds of Source modders who would otherwise have no idea how to implement them.

* **DISCLAIMER**: Mapbase has a strict no-leak-content policy and only allows content created directly by contributors or content originating from open-source repositories.
If you believe any content in Mapbase originates from any leak or unauthorized source (Valve or otherwise), please contact Blixibon immediately.
Mapbase is intended to be usable by everyone, including licensed Source projects and Steam mods.

Mapbase uses content from the following non-Source SDK 2013 Valve games or SDKs:

- Alien Swarm SDK (Used to backport features and code from newer branches of Source into a Source 2013/Half-Life 2 environment)
- Source SDK 2007 Code (Used to implement some of Tony Sergi's code changes)
- Alien Swarm (Used to port assets from the aforementioned SDK code features, e.g. game instructor icons)
- Left 4 Dead (Used to port certain animations as well as assets from the aforementioned SDK code features, e.g. particle rain)
- Half-Life: Source (Used to port friction tool textures)

Valve allows assets from these titles to be distributed for modding purposes. Note that ported assets are only used in the release build, not the code repository.

Mapbase may also contain new third-party software distributed under specific licensing. Please see the bottom of thirdpartylegalnotices.txt for more information.
